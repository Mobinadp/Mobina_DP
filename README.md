Removing image noise is a very important process in medical imaging, this article has a new approach to remove noise from MRI images, which uses a non-subjective filter (NLM) as an advanced algorithm to remove noise in MRI images, and also uses the algorithm A hybrid matching based on DWT and ICA is proposed. Noise removal methods are always used to increase the PSNR and MSSIM of images to improve the originality, and the logic of calculating the LMN size depends on two different categories. This method of selecting the local textures of the image is obtained, where the graphics processor is placed as a complementary hardware platform to the central processing devices in modern computers. The used MRI data is affected by Gaussian noise, speckle noise, salt and pepper noise, respectively. In this article, the method based on the combination of low-band waves combined with the combination of WT and ICA techniques to remove noise from MRI images. It has been suggested.
